# MediaUI

A prefab to turn any VRChat world into a movie world.

## [Docs](https://mediaui.vrc.bz) | [Download](https://mediaui.vrc.bz/get-started/#download-link)

This repository is for transparency purposes. The prefab in the unitypackage can be found in `Assets/MediaUI` and should be able to be used as-is from that folder.
A VPM repo is coming soon, but given that all the tools and guides I can find are outdated or turn my repository inside-out, it may take some time.

Feel free to PR!
